The gold industry is highly dynamic, with gold price fluctuations affecting both 
buyers and sellers. Traditional valuation methods rely on expert opinions and 
historical data but often lack efficiency and objectivity. Recently, machine learning 
(ML) has gained prominence as a robust tool to analyze complex data patterns. 
This research focuses on using ML techniques to develop an accurate gold price 
prediction model by analyzing extensive historical data to identify critical factors 
influencing price variations.

The proposed ML model employs feature engineering techniques such as 
numerical feature scaling, feature selection, and a suite of algorithms like linear 
regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting. Model performance is evaluated 
through metrics like MAPE, RMSE, and MAE. Results indicate the ML model 
significantly outperforms traditional methods in accuracy, offering valuable 
insights for stakeholders in industries like automotive and finance, aiding informed 
decisions in pricing, inventory management, and financial evaluations.
